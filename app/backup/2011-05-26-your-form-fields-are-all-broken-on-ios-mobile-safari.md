If your site has a contact form, login form, or just about any other type of form element, there is a huge chance that you are annoying your iPhone, iPad and iPod touch audience. By default, these devices all offer a few normally helpful features like "autocapitalize" and "autocorrect". The problem lies is the fact that some input fields expect case-sensitive data like username. On [Spelling City][1] we test input fields for correct word spelling, which critically relies upon proper case. Â Asking your users to turn off autocorrect and autocapitalize is not really an adequate solution. Luckily the fix is trivially easy:

As stated in the [Safari Web Content Guide for Designing Forms][2]:

To turn off auto correct and autocapitalize:

<pre class="brush:plain"><input type="text" name="field1" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" />;
</pre>

Please put this on your case-sensitive form fields asap. It doesn't break anything (except maybe W3C validation, which doesn't matter atm with HTML5).
