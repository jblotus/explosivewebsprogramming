Start a blog post, type some words.  It's **crap**, revise. Type it up again, brain freeze. Sigh.

Frustrated, computer errors don't help. **Unbelievable**. *Should I check my email?*

One thousand projects and priorities. Kids need attention, but I'm busy not producing anything.

To much pressure, inner critic too critical. Damn, vacation failed. **Still cynical**.

I've got an idea for a cool new app! Start coding, give up before writing a single line. **Crap**.

Energy sapped, no explanation. Eyes blurry, body aches. Sitting **endlessly**, body wasting.

But I've **no time** to wallow. The water from the fire hose demands a mouth to swallow.

Need to work harder, maybe smarter - *I'll start tomorrow*.
