I'm usually not a fan of these posts, but I felt that doing some reflection would be therapeutic for me. **Fair Warning:** this post is probably going to be very self-indulgent.

In **2012**:

  * My wife and I had our second baby boy
  * My wife and I got married (we did it backwards)
  * Finally talking to my grandparents again after a long strained relationship. Forgiveness is a wonderful thing.
  * I presented a [talk about PHPUnit][1] at my [local PHP user group][2]
  * I attended **8** [SoFlo PHP Users Group meetups][2]
  * [Adam Culp][3], [Pablo Godel][4], [John Gills][5] and I drank beers with [Derick Rethans][6] from [10gen][7] (MongoDB) after [his presentation][8] and argued about the [difference between a British Pint and an American Pint][9]
  * Watched [Rasmus Lerdorf speak][10] and even got to ask him a few questions (about [short array syntax in php 5.4][11]).  *Technically this was December 2011 but I'm still counting it!*
  * I attended [CodeWorks 2012][12], my first conference - albeit a small one - still great times and very eye opening. I even convinced the boss to shell out for it!
  * I helped select talks for  [SunshinePHP][13]. I also built a little app to help rate the talks with [CakePHP][14] at [Adam Culp][3]&#8216;s request. It was and is a great honor to be help out with this upcoming conference. **[Click here to buy tickets][15]**
  * I moved into the lead developer position at [work][16] (on my team) and have really had some great experiences there this year.
  * Made my first [wordpress plugin][17]
  * Started playing [Magic: The Gathering][18] again, via [Magic Online][19] and on the iPad and PC via [Duels of the Planeswalkers][20]. I used to play this almost 17 years ago when I was around 12-13 years old.

Some regrets and sadness in **2012**:

  * I regret not giving more talks, although life definitely got in the way
  * I wanted to see [Robert Martin][21] talk since he was in the area, but missed it
  * My co-worker Conrad shipped off to Atlanta! There are special people in life that teach you things from another perspective and Conrad is definitely one of them.
  * Election Season wasn't nearly as exciting as I had hoped (the primaries sucked out all the energy).

Now for this year's docket. In **2013**:

  * I will attend <a href="http://sunshinephp.com/">SunshinePHP</a>, my first large conference right here in South Florida!
  * I really want to go to [PHPTek13 in Chicago][22], which will hopefully be a watershed moment
  * Take the [Zend Certification Exam for PHP 5.3][23]
  * I am giving a [presentation about Nginx and Memcache][24] at my[ local PHP user group][2]
  * Spend more time playing [Minecraft][25] with my soon to be 4 year-old son. Seriously this is the best.
  * Play less games. My Steam collection is about [142 games and growing][26] and I'm not even counting other sources of games. I must have put hundreds of hours into games this year.
  * <strong>Write more blog posts</strong>. In 2012, I only wrote something like **5** blog posts compared to around **22** for 2011.
  * Finish more software! (<https://github.com/jblotus>) Seriously I start something like **1 **project per week, and usually throw code in it for a day and abandon it. Truthfully I usually do this to play with new libraries and such but it would be nice to actually release something.

So that's all I can think about right now. Here's to the new year! Thanks for reading.
