I started messing around with [Handlebars.js][1], a javascript library that allows for using logicless client side templating based on the [Mustache template language][2]. This makes a lot of sense if you are doing a web application since you can keep a good portion of the business logic on the client side and reduce the burden on your web server.

I spent the weekend making a interactive Handlebars JS demo/template tool which will allow you to compile templates, define contexts and register helpers (or execute any js code since it is using eval()).

Please check it out at [tryhandlebarsjs.com][3] and let me know what you think.
